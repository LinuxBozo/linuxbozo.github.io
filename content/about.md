## I write random shit
I also swear. A lot. I subscribe to the George Carlin belief that there are no bad words, just bad intentions. You can choose to be offended. I don't mind. I also won't stop because you are.

I've been in and around software engineering for close to 25 years. I've seen things. I've been building arbitrary things for much longer. You may find some of this useful. Probably not. This is why I never really wrote anything down before now. What does one more white dude on the Internet really have to say about anything that hasn't already been said, or stolen from someone less represented in the industry. Only recently have I come around to the idea that something I put into words explains some nuance that maybe jives with your way of thinking and it finally clicks for you. If so, that's great. If not, no big deal. Most of this shit is probably just me ignoring the fact that I should probably be in therapy, but the idea of even going makes me anxious.

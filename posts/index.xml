Perhaps you need longer running jobs (a separate discussion on why you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t need this should be happening however), or perhaps you have something hosted internally that you can&amp;rsquo;t quite open up to GitHub Actions externally that you need to access during your build. Whatever the reason, GitHub at least provides you the opportunity to host your own for whatever the situation.</description></item></channel></rss>

I&rsquo;ve been building arbitrary things for much longer. You may find some of this useful. Probably not. This is why I never really wrote anything down before now. What does one more white dude on the Internet really have to say about anything that hasn&rsquo;t already been said, or stolen from someone less represented in the industry. Only recently have I come around to the idea that something I put into words explains some nuance that maybe jives with your way of thinking and it finally clicks for you. If so, that&rsquo;s great. If not, no big deal. Most of this shit is probably just me ignoring the fact that I should probably be in therapy, but the idea of even going makes me anxious.</p></div><div class=post-footer></div></article></main></body></html>

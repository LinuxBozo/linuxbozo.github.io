Perhaps you need longer running jobs (a separate discussion on why you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t need this should be happening however), or perhaps you have something hosted internally that you can&amp;rsquo;t quite open up to GitHub Actions externally that you need to access during your build. Whatever the reason, GitHub at least provides you the opportunity to host your own for whatever the situation.</description></item><item><title>About</title><link>https://linuxbozo.github.io/about/</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 Feb 2021 00:16:41 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://linuxbozo.github.io/about/</guid><description>I write random shit I also swear. A lot. I subscribe to the George Carlin belief that there are no bad words, just bad intentions. You can choose to be offended. I don&amp;rsquo;t mind. I also won&amp;rsquo;t stop because you are.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been in and around software engineering for close to 25 years. I&amp;rsquo;ve seen things. I&amp;rsquo;ve been building arbitrary things for much longer. You may find some of this useful.</description></item></channel></rss>
